These are my Advent2020 solutions.

The data and problem description have been removed from each (for copyright and spoiler reasons).

There are generally no comments because, well, speed is a factor (though I'm not close to being on the leaderboard; it's still fun to try to solve these as quick as possible).

Each `dayX.py` puzzle solution reads the data either from stdin or a filename argument on the command line (using Python's `fileinput` module).  ie:

```
$ python3 day1.py data.txt
```

or

```
$ python3 day2.py <data.txt
```

Note - you must get the data.txt itself from the Advent2020 site while doing the puzzles.
